[I read this blog post last year.](https://blog.usejournal.com/working-for-the-weekend-9a7fb8ddb635) It’s written by an Asian-American improviser at UCB New York, which is a comedy theater and training center for improv comedy. In this blog post, the author talks about how she was passed over for a Weekend Team at UCB. The short of it is, the theater’s Artistic Director cited ‘lack of chemistry’ between her and the team as a reason to reject her, even when the people on the team advocated for her. 

The ‘chemistry’ argument is used by all-white groups - not just in improv comedy but in professional settings and social circles. Just two weeks ago one of my white friends used the word ‘chemistry’ as an excuse to perpetuate their all-white theater group. 

“We’ve tried to bring in POC members but they never stick around, and we work well together with the current members so we’re just going to keep it this way. The chemistry just works.”

Chemistry is a difficult thing to describe, it’s the unexplainable factor, which is exactly what’s so insidiously racist about using it as an excuse to exclude not-white people. It shuts down the conversation. It’s lazy, it’s uncaring, it’s all the adjectives we use to describe racist behavior. 

Let’s also be clear, when we talk about chemistry in any sort of white group, not just an all-white improv comedy group, what we’re really talking about is white chemistry. What we’re saying is that an improv group’s ‘group mind’ is actually a white mind. Why? Because American culture is steeped in white-centrism including, very noticeably, improv comedy.

#### What is chemistry?

I’m not an academic, but I do know how to Google. This is a working list of things that make up what we typically experience as platonic chemistry:


* Non-judgment
* Similarity
* Mystery
* Attraction
* Mutual trust
* Effortless communication
* Sincerity

via Wikipedia:

> "Chemistry occurred most often between people who are down-to-earth and sincere".
> This is because "if a person is comfortable with themselves, they are better able to express their true self to the world, which makes it easier to get to know them...
> even if perspectives on important matters differed." 

> **"Sharing similarities is also deemed essential to chemistry as "feeling understood is essential to forming relational bonds."**

You see the problem, right? 

#### ‘Chemistry’ is a racist excuse

I can tell you for a fact, that a not-white person isn’t going to ever feel totally comfortable with themselves and best able to express their true self in a room full of all-white / predominantly white people where the context of the experience is centered on whiteness. 

And if you’ve added someone to any team or organization on the basis of inclusion (read: because they’re not-white), guess what - THEY’RE NOT SIMILAR TO YOU. THAT’S WHY THEY’RE FUCKING THERE. 

Diversity Initiative failure in a nutshell: Let's bring in this not-white person because they're not-white and then reject them because we don't know how to stop being centered on our whiteness which will inherently affect chemistry with this person.

The type of chemistry that’s being referenced by white people to justify their all-white group is a chemistry that exists among people who share cultural-sameness.

Anecdote: I have a Korean-American friend who commented to me once about a new friend he had made. This new friend was also Korean-American. He noted how it was such a pleasure meeting this person. He felt like there was an unspoken understanding that gave their conversations a sense of ease. 

That understanding came from a shared Korean-American experience, a shared cultural knowledge base. There was something familiar and recognizable about that person’s history and experiences that brought a sense of instant comfort and connection.

Different cultures have different norms including perspectives and expressions of behaviors (loving, hating, lazying, etc). This is some real basic shit. Americans have ways of expressing behaviors. French people have certain ways of expressing behaviors. Japanese people have their own sets of expressing behaviors. If you’ve ever travelled internationally you know what I’m talking about. 

If you’ve been surrounded by the particular expressions of one predominant culture your whole life, those expressions will seem like the norm. They’ll feel familiar, recognizable and thus will put you in a state of ease. When you hold the belief that there is one predominent norm for all people in terms of how behavior should be expressed and you’re faced with expressions of behavior or perspective that’s not in line with what you perceive as the norm, this experience may not feel like instant or good chemistry.

Sometimes you have to work harder to achieve that relationship ‘flow’ that you often experience with people of the same culture because there is more room in this case for misunderstanding or lack of understanding. It takes time and effort sometimes to appreciate a new perspective. 

The above relies on a degree of generalization. Individuals don't automatically have great chemistry just because they're the same race or belong to the same culture. But you get my point. 

When white Americans talk about chemistry, they’re in part talking about the comfort and ease that comes from shared history and experiences that are based in whiteness. 

It’s not a bad thing to have culture-based chemistry with your friends, colleagues, fellow performers. It is, however, bad when you are ignorant about the basis of what you call ‘chemistry’ and use that chemistry as the measuring stick to exclude not-white people. 

As anti-racists, we know and accept that whiteness is not the norm. If you haven’t arrived on this truth, please see the About page of this blog for some suggested reading. 

Stop excluding not-white people based on chemistry. It's just another way that you are harmfully centering on your whiteness. 

#### Why don’t not-white people stick around when invited to an all / predominantly white group?

* Unchecked microaggressions.
* Unchecked white fragility. 
* The shittiness of constantly being steeped in white centrism. 
* Tokenism
* Words and actions that signal disrespect for other cultures indicating an underlying belief that white culture is superior. 
* Gaslighting
* White people generally not ceding space for the not-white individual(s).
* White woman tears
* White people not showing any interest whatsoever in the not-white person’s perspective or culture
* Lack of support or mentorship
* Tone policing
* Etc etc etc

Not-white people are traumatized when exposed to the above injustices and oftentimes drop out, for good reason. And hence, the group is left to deem the white people who have remained as ‘self selecting’ because they have ‘chemistry’. But unlike what you want to comfortably believe, it’s not that the not-white individuals didn’t want to commit, you drove them away with your conscious and unconscious biases. 

If you’ve had the following thoughts about yet another not-white person who bowed out of your group, it’s time to make a shift from racist to anti-racist thinking and behavior:

*We didn’t do anything wrong, they just didn’t fit, therefore we don’t feel guilty about the fact that we’re all white. We’re the exception, there’s just something really fucking special about us and to add another person, not-white or otherwise, will throw off the whole thing. By the way, no one’s really reached out to that person to ask them why they stepped away because we didn’t really like them being in the group anyway because, you know, chemistry. They said they were too busy so they’re probably just too fucking busy.*

#### Do better by reconsidering chemistry

You will have chemistry very quickly with some people. With others, it’s incumbent on you to make the effort and take the extra time to try and build chemistry by not centering on your experiences and not regarding your white culture as the norm. It’s not the job of other cultures to fit neatly into the context of white culture. Other cultures don’t give a fuck about fitting into white culture.

**If you have members of the group representing other cultures and perspectives, sometimes you have to build a bridge. Do this by genuinely being interested in that person’s perspective and lived experiences with the aim of finding commonalities.** 

**You may not initially have many shared experiences to bind you. Accept that finding commonalities and creating shared experiences will take time and more effort than finding chemistry with people who have historically been as invested in white culture as you have. This is the new work in the new norm.** 

**Take more time to actively build chemistry.** 

#### To do list

Below are a list of attitudes and behaviors that are needed to ACTUALLY make an effort towards multiculturalism and away from white-centrism within a group dynamic:

* Sincerely express in words and behaviors that you are open and interested in other cultures and perspectives and cede the space. Part of achieving this is to stop talking. Don’t do this performatively. 
* Sincerely express in words and behaviors that you are excited to have individuals of not-white cultures and perspectives in the group. Don’t rely on the women in the group to do it for you. Don’t do this performatively. 
* Sincerely express in words and behaviors that you are committed to giving space for not-white perspective and culture. Part of achieving this is to stop talking. Don’t do this performatively. 
* Spend time together with a sincere commitment to developing rapport, time that isn’t spent being white-centric. 
* Give the ‘chemistry’ some extra time. Extra time is needed for things that may not feel like instant connection - communication styles, perspectives, cultural norms, experiences. 
* Be committed to asking questions instead of judging. It’s not that the other person isn’t making sense. YOU may lack knowledge necessary to understand what’s being said. If you are welcoming other perspectives into your group, you are bearing a cultural ignorance and it takes time for you to develop the knowledge base of the perspective being presented to you that you’ve committed to ceding space for. If you’re not interested, you are the problem. Deal with it on your own time. Show up next time as a better antiracist.
* Recognize there’s a strong undercurrent of rage. If a not-white person expresses themselves in a less than calm manner (that doesn’t present as dangerous behavior), consider it part of the social contract and don’t police their tone. Cede reasonable amounts of space for all of their expressions and be nonjudgmental and loving. Forgive. Give the benefit of the doubt until you can’t. Because if you truly can’t, it’s not lack of chemistry, it’s incompatibility which is a valid reason to say someone doesn’t jive with the group. More on this later.
* Have open dialogue about hard things like race, gender, etc. Commit to a loving, sincere tone for these discussions and approach with openness and humility. Watch how much you are talking. If you are a white person who talks a lot or a cisgendered person who talks a lot, this is not the time to talk a lot. Show your strength and allyship by piping down and listening. Don’t just wait for your turn to speak, don’t spend your time while the others are talking, forming a rebuttal or preparing additional info to show off your knowledge. Stop trying to have the last word. Quiet your mind and listen with your heart. 
* Even if you’re in a leadership position, do not use your position as an excuse to talk so damn much. No one needs you to reiterate or reframe things, especially things that are not your lived experiences. 
* **Listen more, talk less. The most loving and badass thing you can do is to have the confidence to be a listener.** 
* Immediately stand up for the not-white person when something is said or done that is insensitive. You will make the offender feel and look bad, but resist prioritizing white woman’s tears over the not-white person’s trauma. Unfortunately it’s one or the other and there is a right and wrong choice here. Even if you’re not 100% sure it was insensitive, just do a quick check-in. 
* Know that it’s appreciated when you save the not-white person from doing the emotional labor of trying to rectify an insensitive situation. Get off the back wall of racism and be ready to jump in. All hands on deck, all the time. 
* De-center your whiteness by being aware of how much conversation you’re making based on white culture. Are you exclusively watching shows on your Netflix about white people? Do you spend your leisure time in spaces that are exclusively white? Multiculturalize your taste by seeking out not-white entertainment. Stop supporting establishments that are exclusive. Surround yourself with not-white people. Talk about them, quote them, learn from them, love them. Cede space in your hearts and consciousness to not-white culture and people. You will likely find yourself, without much effort, ceding white centrism in all the spaces that you inhabit as a byproduct of being more open and curious. 
* Stop complaining that all of this sucks and drains all the fun. You know what’s not fun? Racist white people. Domineering, racist white people are literally only fun to each other. 
* Monitor how much space you’re taking up. Limit the time you speak, limit your presence. Limit your ego. Limit your needs. Whiteness is already overrepresented. Showing allyship is as simple as limiting your perspective. Talk less. Yes, I'm being repetitive, I'm doing it on purpose. 
* Spend your own time learning about that person’s culture. However, don’t explain your new knowledge to that person the next time you see them! White people, under no circumstances, should ever explain a culture to a person of that culture. Just let the knowledge inform your relationship in the background. Don’t somehow make this exercise about you.
* Ceding space can lead to silences. Resist labeling it as awkward. Regard that silence as a new experience in progress. It’s okay if the process is imperfect, it’s okay to mess it up and say the wrong thing, it’s okay to walk away frustrated or wishing it were easier. It’s okay as long as you keep doing the work, keep showing up, keep acknowledging that you messed up and that you’ll do better next time, it’s okay if you’re still committed and enduring. If apologizing in public is not your strong point, figure it out and get comfortable doing it.
* Know that all of these things, for white Americans, are self-imposed limits on one’s presence in the space. Know that ironically you will feel good if you’re doing it right because these are actually exercises in expressing love and kindness.

#### Extrapolate the lessons here to cede space to other marginalized groups. 

Women. Non-binary. Differently abled. Etc. 

#### Incompatibility

If there’s someone in your group who isn’t fitting in, it could be that they’re incompatible. Incompatibility is a different thing from chemistry. If the group’s predominant values are at odds with a particular member, that member is probably not right for the group. 

For instance, if that person is filled with hate speech and the rest of the group members are committed to non-bigotry, the bigot does not fit. Make decisions based on compatibility and take a less white-centric approach to chemistry. 

Compatibility is rooted in values. What are your group’s or organization’s values?

Lastly, there are times when there is LEGIT bad chemistry in a group. Sometimes it's just sort of...not sparky. My own perspective on this, is that bad chemistry is often the result of a lack of openness and authenticity. Also, sometimes bad chemistry is a result of a lack of diversity — perspectives, experiences, introversion vs extroversion, etc.

If you've tried and tried and there's bad chemistry, there's bad chemistry. 

But at least make a true effort at chemistry by putting in the time and effort instead of discriminating on the basis of white chemistry from a safe, privileged vantage point. 

#### Final thoughts

For not-white people, it’s incumbent on you to show up with sincerity and have the courage to be who you are as your fullest self and resist disappearing into white perspective. If the group is ceding space for you, take the space and fill it with yourself and the culture(s) that you represent. Don’t do it to be disruptive, but to take the space. 

Operate under the expectation that if team members don’t understand something you said or your perspective, that they will respectfully ask with openness and curiosity. If the group is subjecting you to unchecked racist behavior, save your energy. Leave the group. Report the group. You deserve to be in environments that are set up for you to thrive.
