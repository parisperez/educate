Recently I spent almost two hours having a socially distanced visit with a well-intentioned white friend. We talked about the problematic issue of white-centrism for almost the entirety of the hang out. Without irony, my friend proceeded to dominate the conversation by doing 90% of the talking. 

Each time I tried to swing the conversation to share my not-white experiences and perspective, they gave me unsolicited advice and rattled off sources and materials that they thought could ‘help’ me. They were being completely self-centered and doing what I can now identify as 'dismissive listening'. 

Never did I hear phrases such as:

“Tell me more about that…”  

“What’s the goal of what you’re trying to achieve?”  

“I don’t have the answers but your perspective is really important to me.”  

“I’ve been talking a lot. I’m going to be quiet now and listen.”

This person's domineering behavior was so egregious that they actually ignored my eight-month-old daughter’s crying and proceeded to talk over me while I tried to tell them that my baby had enough and we had to go. I literally had to point at my crying child and shout over them to get them to stop talking.

The worst part is that there was no one else around. It was just the two of us. This means, if I want this person held accountable for adding yet another traumatic experience to the list of my lifelong traumatic experiences, I have to endure more emotional labor by having 'the tough talk' with them myself. 

No thanks. Seriously. 

Unfortunately, instances where I’m faced with being surrounded by white people dominating the exchange of thoughts and ideas is constant. 

Coming out of COVID / BLM Unrest, it’s going to be a new world. I’m grateful for the time to have been forced to meditate on how I can better cultivate a life that nurtures me, where my daily experiences are in harmony with my desire to thrive and my emotional / intellectual impact isn’t systematically being minimized.

I’ve decided that when I’m re-entering the world post-COVID and reuniting with my friends and loved ones it will be under an intentional effort towards multicultural exposure. I'll be mindfully minimizing my time and interaction with white people in order to rid my daily experiences of the presence of white supremacy and white dominance. 

#### Tenets of cultivating multicultural exposure

- I will spend my time creating and cultivating relationships with more not-white people. 
- I will prioritize experiences that are multicultural. That means, gatherings of any kind where I’m the only not-white person will be de-prioritized for ones where a multitude of perspectives are shared and enjoyed. 
- My minimum requirement for participating in gatherings is that there's at least one other not-white person present. Having at least two not-white people in a room has a natural way of holding white people accountable for their actions and cutting back on microagressions. 
- If I must participate in a formal gathering or meeting that is all / predominantly white, I'll request that the gathering engage in the practice of Time Keeping.

#### Time Keeping as a strategy for ceding space

Most of my friends and colleagues who are white, truly seem to be striving towards allyship. However, even in a room with the most activated white allyship, if I’m a not-white person in a meeting with all white people, everyone in that room is still gathering to operate under the dominance of white thinking. 

**Time Keeping**, is a practice that white participants in a formal gathering or meeting can opt into to show their commitment to ceding space.

The purpose of this practice is to hold all people in the room accountable for acknowledging the racial power dynamics in the room and their role in it. 

In this way, whiteness is not the unobservable water that the participants swim in, but white dominance is recognized as a threat to multiculturalism that each participant agrees to keep in check for the duration of the meeting and the subsequent follow up.

Time Keeping is a simple concept. It entails tracking the minutes that each person spends talking. It's also a tool to help participants be mindful of the quality of the responses and feedback to ideas. 

Domineering behavior such as offering unsolicited advice or using passive-aggression or micro aggressions should raise a red flag and will be encumbent on ALL of the white participants to take turns stepping in and course correcting. 

Time keeping will literally be done by each person using a stopwatch to track each others' participation (talking, asking questions, responding and in any other way pulling focus) and keeping a tally in a shareable doc to be shared with all participants at the end of the meeting. 

To reiterate, EACH participant keeps tally of EVERYONE ELSE'S time talking, including their own. There are no 'time outs' or exceptions. This way, each participant is held accountable and not sitting back in passivity. 

Time can be tracked in a shared document like Google docs (where edits are version controlled). All participants track each other's time and their own throughout the meeting.

**Taking a leadership role in the meeting will not be seen as a valid reason to pull more focus.** 

At the end of EACH meeting, the white participants should seek the not-white participant(s) overall take on the success/failure of the meeting. Specifically, did the meeting succeed/fail to provide an anti-racist space where they felt able to thrive? 

I say 'white participants should SEEK..." and not 'not-white participants should PROVIDE' because none of this matters if white people aren't actively engaged with the feedback. 

If the feedback from the not-white participant comes in the form of notes at the bottom of the time keeping document, the goal of time keeping is only met when white participants double back and ingest the thoughts shared by the not-white participant in those notes for reflection and future course correcting. The post-meeting feedback notes are more an action item for white people to read and understand than it is for the not-white participant to write up. 

If you're at odds with who / how many people should provide the feedback - ask yourself, why should you or any one else's opinion/analysis matter more? What's at stake and for whom? 

#### The goals of Time Keeping:

* To ensure that the not-white voice is heard, and that the ratio of ideas exchanged is one that’s done intentionally and thoughtfully. 
* To ensure that the not-white feedback is sought with intention and considered with as much weight as is given to the white people, especially men, in the meeting.
* To acknowledge the problematic dominance of white perspective. 
* To challenge the perverse and pervasive normative that those who shout over others and are long-winded and simply like to hear themselves talk should have the greatest influence over our lives. Talking does not equal intelligence, wisdom or insightfullness. 
* To drive behavior shifts over time to be more in line with our antiracist values. 
* To serve as a reminder that there is work to be done. 
* To benchmark progress of our behavior shift and avoid the backslide into false normalcy where white supremacy flourishes unchecked. 
* To serve as an analytics that we can all look at together and feel a deep sense of pride in our collective progress and commitment to antiracism.  
* To bring a sense of certainty in these horribly uncertain times, that we are, in fact, doing something to move in a new direction. 
* To serve as a starting point for creating transformative policies that champion antiracism and embraces multiculturalism.
* To thoughtfully limit the white perspective as a means of ceding space and achieving balance with not-white perspectives. 

This last point is important. The goal is to balance the white perspective with not-white perspectives and not necessarily to balance time spent on each individual's perspective. The goal is not just to make room for everyone to talk, it's to cede space for not-white perspectives. 

Example: If there are many white people in a meeting with one not-white person and the meeting is intended to go for 30 minutes, the white people as a total should share their perspective in proportion to the not-white person's perspective (15 minutes white perspective / 15 minutes not-white perspective). 

Yes, the time allotment in a certain sense gives one individual a lot of space to speak. This is yet another reason to have more than one not-white person in the room. It's encumbent on you to play a part in bringing more diversity to the discussion by inviting more not-white people. 

*I'm white. Can I talk more if I intend to additionally represent a perspective that is not-white or in any other way not my own?* 

**NO. BECAUSE YOU ARE WHITE AND ASSUMING A PERSPECTIVE THAT ISN'T YOUR OWN IS OFFENSIVE.** 

Stop trying to talk more. Commit to ceding space. 

#### How to get it started

Introduce the concept in advance of the first meeting, making sure each participant knows what it is and provide a link to a template for recording Time Keeping. Have each participant acknowledge that they read the material. If they don't sign off, disinvite them from the meeting. Niceness has no place in rolling back racism. 

In the first meeting, let there be an open vote. If a white person objects to the practice of Time Keeping, they’ve just outed themselves as someone who is unwilling to do the work and is, essentially, a problematic racist and should be reported / dealt with accordingly subsequent to the meeting. They also, obviously, shouldn't be allowed to participate in future meetings. 

#### Why is Time Keeping really necessary?

Why would I intentionally frustrate all of my white friends and colleagues by asking them to self-limit? Because in the long run, it makes absolutely no sense to not do this. Time Keeping seems drastic, but in fact, this is the only way forward to achieving change on a group / institutional level.

**If there’s going to be change, experiences need to be measured and recorded, or there will be no basis for reflection and thus change. With Time Keeping, accountability can be tracked, measured, discussed, and strategy / conversations can take form.**

The fact that it feels like a blunt tool is indicative of the state we're in. We literally need to keep each other in check because there is so much that's new in the new norm. We have to rewrite the rules and some of the rules are going to come with training wheels. 

Also, to be honest,  corporate America has long adopted a version of Time Keeping, it's called Time Sheets. You're probably doing it right now. Time Sheets are little forms that employees have to fill out every day to report how many hours they worked and on what task so that they can get paid for the work that they're supposed to be doing. 

Time Sheets used to be called Punch Cards. Everybody did them. If you don't know what I'm talking about see this video of [Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECa1toPGth4)

Americans are very familiar with having their time tracked to stay accountable to racist capitalism. Let's start punching in our cards to track instead, our commitment to anti-racism. 

#### Potential organization-wide benefits

Imagine if every organization practiced Time Keeping? The benefits would go beyond ceding space to not-white people but to other marginalized groups as well. 

* differently abled
* non-binary
* women
* varying age groups
* introverts
* etc etc etc

It's in almost everyone's interest, with the exception of white men, to push 'limited perspective' agencies and organizations to adopt Time Keeping to drive diversity and become 'multiperspective' agencies / organizations.  

#### What to do if you're in an all-white group? 

You have a whole day full of all-white meetings literally tomorrow. Don't cry.

I would encourage white people who participate in all-white meetings to push for timekeeping immediately. In this context, Time Keeping can be practiced as a symbolic reminder that the goal of inclusion is being unmet and that the organization is failing to live up to the standards of diversity and multiculturalism. Collectively acknowledge the missing voice. It's at least a starting point and a signal of intent.

From a not-white person's perspective, if I knew that a group was operating as all-white but I also knew they were practicing Time Keeping, it would signal to me that they were at least on the path to allyship. Conversely, an all-white group that doesn't practice Time Keeping would without a doubt lead me to assume they're a problematic, racist organization. Being anti-racist takes action in a world where racism is the default. 

However, if an all-white group who's been practicing Time Keeping for three months still only has white members, Time Keeping is not really being practiced here and is not much more than posturing, performative bullshit. If you think that inviting not-white people into your all-white group will somehow mess up the group chemistry, [read this post on chemistry and find out why this is problematic.](/the-chemistry-argument-and-why-it-s-racist/) 

If your group / organization is all white, the best PR you could do in my opinion is to start Time Keeping as soon as possible and PUBLISH the statistics from the meetings. If you're doing the work as anti-racists, publishing your progress and being radically brave and radically open will inspire other groups to do the same and also signal to not-white people that they can trust your allyship. 

You know what truly isn't doing the work but only feels like 'doing the work'? When white groups and organizations act like they're doing everything right, but they're not actually doing anything that goes beyond temporary, performative BS where policy is functionally unchanged. 

If you wanted ideas to truly dismantle a system of white supremacy — that go beyond reposting, signing petitions, reading books, ruminating — that actually influence behavior and possibly policy from the ground up, this is it. It may not be perfect, but it's better than what you're doing now. 

This is ongoing work that flies in the face of BS, one-off diversity training. If you're looking for experts to come up with ideas for the daily, ongoing behavior shift, they probably don't exist because America, to its very backbone, is a racist institution. WE HAVE TO FUCKING MAKE THIS SHIT UP OURSELVES. 

**You don't have to pretend to be perfect in the current climate to be on the right side of history. In fact, you can be deeply imperfect and still be a fucking hero just by taking baby steps towards the creation of a more equitable community.** 

**You literally just have to be brave enough to go against the grain of the default state (racism) and commit to ceding space to perspectives other than your own. If you're just taking one step onto the path, this is a huge win.**  

#### FINAL THOUGHTS

While all-white gatherings at work, school, social circles, etc. have always been regarded as the standard and the norm in America, it’s actually a state of failure from a human rights perspective when these gatherings are on the decision-making and culture creating level. To recognize this is the first step in spurring organizations into a new anti-racist direction. Time Keeping can be used as a catalyst for driving this change. The place to start driving things forward is in your own circles.
