description: "Are your inclusion workshops and bias-trainings designed to treat all participants equally and afford them a safe space? If the facilitators of an inclusion workshop aren’t careful about recognizing and facilitating for the type of emotional labor and vulnerability that some of the participants are experiencing for the benefit of the group, you can leave them to perform invisible labor and also to re-experience past trauma."

There’s a comedy theater in PDX where anyone can enroll to take improv comedy classes. However, a prerequisite to participating in the class and participating in the community as a student, is to sign a non-harassment policy form. 

The non-harassment policy form covers the usual suspects of issues including hate speech, sexual predation, bigotry of any kind on the grounds of sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious beliefs, etc. On the first day of class, all students along with the teacher, sign a hard copy of the non-harassment policy before any instruction begins. 

If a student refuses to sign (not sure if this has ever happened), they won’t be allowed to participate in class.

I recently participated in an inclusion training workshop for teachers. The non-mandatory training paid active teachers for their participation. Furloughed teachers had the option to participate but were not paid. This led to some interesting outcomes that led me to wonder...why are employees paid to participate in inclusion training and why is inclusion training for employees optional? 

Paying some teachers for participating and not paying other teachers to attend the same session can result in the following mix of participants in the same workshop: 

* White cisgendered male participants who are paid to participate. Their insights into the impact of bigoted behavior are largely observational and their experience of bigotry is largely reflective on how their own behavior has contributed to harmful outcomes. 

* Participants of marginalized groups - POC, BIPOC, transgendered, women, etc, - NOT paid but voluntarily participating. Their insights into the impact of bigoted behavior are also reflective, observational, but ALSO include experiences of being the target of harmful, bigoted behavior. 

There are other combinations of participants and their identities of course, but the combo of the above seems the most problematic when the workshop includes exercises such as sharing real life experiences of harmful behavior and coming up with solutions as a group  to best handle these situations. Hypothetical situations can be used, but participants in the workshop that I attended were encouraged to draw from real life experiences as these tend to be richer in their complexity. 

This puts all participants from marginalized groups in a state of great vulnerability as oftentimes this means talking about experiences that were humiliating at the very least, and traumatizing at the very worst. To talk about these experiences can be retraumatizing and unavoidably demands emotional labor on their part for the benefit of the group. **Recounting one’s own experiences can have this effect, and also listening to the experiences of those in the same marginalized group(s) as yourself recount their experiences of being targeted can also have this effect.** 

If I’m a POC being asked to share in a group of people, including people I don’t even know, about my traumatizing experiences for the benefit of that group, I really don’t want to be doing this when the person next to me is a cisgendered white male who's being paid to be there. The monetary incentive piece is important. It plants the possibility in my mind that I’m being forced into a state of vulnerability, sometimes without warning, in front of someone who may not give a fuck and isn’t engaging on much more than an intellectual level because their motivation for being there is monetary compensation. In my view, the experience created above is a major process failure. The workshop design fails to afford a safe space equally for all of the participants.

#### The Gray Area

The fact that participation is incentivized creates a gray area as to the intention behind participation:

Are some participants only there because they’re being paid? 

Would they not be there if they weren’t paid? 

Should the opportunity for these perceptions exist? 

How do the incentives affect how participants approach the work and what they think their level of emotional engagement should be?

What does the gray area of intent created by incentives, founded or unfounded, affect marginalized individuals in the group? Does it work to de-incentivize unpaid participants to engage fully, or even to participate at all?
 
If the facilitators of an inclusion workshop aren’t careful about recognizing and facilitating for the type of emotional labor and vulnerability that some of the participants are being asked to do / experience for the benefit of all, you can leave them to perform invisible labor. I think we can agree this is bad on many levels. 

Even worse, they may not be paid to be there unlike some of the other participants who in the worst case scenario, are white / perceived as white (hold the most privilege) and are also paid to be there. This creates a perception of even greater inequity. 


#### Takeaways 

* Facilitators - check your own internal biases before attempting to do this work. The white male facilitator in my workshop had a clear gender bias against women which he seemed unaware of. No one’s expected to be perfect but if you’re leading a workshop on inclusion, you shouldn’t be doing this work if you have glaring unchecked biases that can undermine the entire experience. If you display what could be interpreted as questionable behavior once, that’s human and doesn’t necessarily mean you hold bias. If it happens three times, the sad fact is that you could very well be doing harm in a workshop about not doing harm. 
* Let participants know ahead of time that emotional labor may be required of them in the workshop and briefly describe the types of exercises that will require emotional labor. Provide this info before people RSVP. 
* Facilitators should also participate and offer instances that require their own vulnerability. Do not skip this step. The power dynamic here is important. The last thing any human wants is to be put in a vulnerable state, sharing about one’s trauma, to have it then immediately analyzed intellectually by facilitators, again in the worst case, two white men, who are visibly emotionally removed.  
* Ask yourself what paying your participants does to the work. The theater that I mentioned at the beginning of this post, doesn’t hand out candy to those who agree to sign the non-harassment policy agreement. It’s a prerequisite that you agree in writing to do no harm to the community members at that theater. Shouldn’t it be a prerequisite for teachers, employees, managers, etc. in any institution to agree to do no harm in the area of inclusion, just as they do with non-harassment? If inclusion is a bar that is truly set for any institution or organization, individuals who want to be a part of that organization should show up to do the training, not because they’re incentivized, but because they agree they should do it as good human beings who value the dignity of other human beings. 
* For organization leaders - ask yourselves why you’re making inclusion training voluntary and not mandatory. What message does that send? If you’ve offered a workshop to an organization member several times and they don’t make time to participate, can you draw a conclusion from their behavior? What if they declined to show up until they were paid? Does that say something? 
* For organization leaders, what kinds of attitudes and beliefs are being reinforced when you pay your participants to attend inclusion training? What about when you combine that with making inclusion workshops optional and not mandatory? What types of behavior around participation / non-participation presents as a red flag? What does compensation do to muddle or clarify this red flag? 
* For participants, not from marginalized groups, mainly meaning white people and more specifically white men — please know that the emotional toll placed on you in these workshops is real but not the same as being retraumatized or triggered. When I share real life experiences of being targeted for any part of my marginalized identity, the emotional blow to those in the room who know me, who care about me, can be felt. Without them saying a word, I know that they are devastated to know what I’ve endured. The emotional impact of being in an inclusion workshop for you is real and can be very deep. This post is not to say whose emotional work in these sessions are greater or deeper, qualified or unqualified, valid or invalid. It’s just to say that being retraumatized, triggered, these are specific experiences and should be recognized and addressed. How do we address it? How do we account for it? How do we create a safe space for it? The experiences that I’ve had so far in formalized inclusion trainings don’t seem to address it at all. It’s just a glaring blind spot. 
* For facilitators and organization leaders, if you are designing your inclusion workshop experiences to be intellectual exercises alone, you’re doing it wrong. This work is and should be emotionally transformative.
* Design your inclusion workshop, not just the content in it, but the communication around it beforehand and afterwards, with qualified members of marginalized groups. 
* Ask for feedback on how it went from participants of marginalized groups. 
Facilitators should verbally recognize, take care of, facilitate for, show appreciation for the emotional labor of participants from marginalized groups. Recognize that this itself is an area where harm can unintentionally be inflicted if there’s no process for it. 
* Organization leaders, consider the word ‘training’ in the term Inclusion Training and whether there’s a better word to be used. Learning to handle problematic situations that threaten emotional harm on those around you requires emotional engagement. Ask yourself if the word ‘training’ is causing the people in your organization to show up to these workshops with less than ideal attitudes or perception about the type of engagement necessary. Protecting people from being the targets of bigotry is not the same thing as learning how to use new timesheet software. 
* There should be ongoing dialogue between organization leaders and organization members from marginalized groups about the additional emotional labor placed on them as they attempt to fulfill their roles. Recognize how much their presence is crucial to fostering a diverse community in your organization and that they are fulfilling the role with a margin of burden not felt by their non-marginalized counterparts.

I commend every individual who provides, leads and participates in inclusion training. It’s complex and it’s hard work. We all know that most of the time so far in our history, they’ve been largely ineffective which is a shame given the invisible, emotional labor put into them by some of the participants. This has to change. 

The biggest takeaway I’ve had so far from participating, aside from the above, is that there is no perfect answer that fits every problem situation that can arise. Being the target of bigotry affects individuals in unique ways. But caring deeply and making the effort, sometimes ongoing effort, to try to right any wrongs is good work. 

Doing nothing, saying nothing, running away from discomfort, is the enemy. Saying something to protect someone who’s become a target intentionally or otherwise, is a million times better than not doing anything. 

<!-- This week, I made the difficult decision to not join the Wall of Moms here in Portland. I don’t know what the chemicals in tear gas might do to the composition of my breast milk while I’m currently nursing my 10-month-old. Stress levels alone can alter the composition of breast milk to contain unhealthy levels of cortisol that can adversely affect a baby. It hurts me to not participate, to sit it out while others put themselves at risk. I hope that going through the headache of doing the meditation and showing up for the experiences necessary to write this blog is doing something by way of contributing to the fight.  -->
