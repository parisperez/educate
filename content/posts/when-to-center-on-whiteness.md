Do you notice how uncomfortable you’ve become lately as the terms ‘white people’ and ‘whiteness’ have entered the everyday vocabulary of Americans? They land with a bit of a sting, don't they? 

As a POC, I can’t help but feel racist using those terms. And yet — it seems so normal to throw around terms like POC and BIPOC. It seems so normal to use terms like Latino and Black. 

Language is one of the cunning devices that’s used to protect the white power structure by deflecting attention away from white people and constantly calling into attention the not-whiteness of others. 

That feeling that somehow I’m being racist by using the terms ‘white people’ and ‘whiteness’ is really just my fear of challenging the white power structure by calling out white people as the subjects in my sentences in the active voice. It's me recognizing that I'm breaking from the norm of pointing out the skin color of BIPOC and POC while leaving whiteness unnamed and undefined. 

Compare:

“Black woman shot by neighbor.”

vs:

“White man murders neighbor in hate crime.”

Don’t be complicit in the use of language to allow white supremacy and white privilege to hide behind words.

Don’t let murderers go free by allowing them to hide behind words and the names of their victims. 

When talking about hate crimes and the crimes of white capitalism, center on the white people commiting the action. Strike the words POC and BIPOC from your vocabulary.  

Example:

“White Americans benefit from the enslavement of not-white people in modern day America.”

"As a white person, I’m working on dismantling my learned white fragility in order to cede space and power to those who don’t share my unearned and destructive levels of privilege.” 

If this feels uncomfortable, know this: POC and BIPOC have NEVER been comfortable having their skin color pointed out by white people. This practice was invented by white people for the benefit of rich, property-owning whites. 

If you’re serious about doing the work of dismantling the racist power structure in this country, this is the work. 

Come out from under the warm, comforting blanket of words and courageously speak about racism with white people as the subject in your sentences and put it in the active voice.
