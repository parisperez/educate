Just a pause here to address the underlying emotions behind this blog. On the daily, I’m fighting THAT voice in my mind. Here are the nasty things that **THAT** voice is shouting near constantly:

*You can never publish this. An army of highly educated white men who are more versed at arguing publicly and who also garner the support of the white power structure will come along and dissect what you’ve written until you’re nothing but a bone-dry carcass under the hot, hot desert sun.*

*You’re breaking the social contract with your daughter by inviting criticism and disdain like this. Your inbox will be flooded with angry emails that will drain your energy and eat away at your soul — energy that you need to be a mother to your child.*

*You’ll never catch all the typos. What a terrible idea to publish anything while you’re feeling so much emotional upheaval.*

*What you publish today will surely cause you mortification a year from now* 

*You’re not an academic. Why do you feel entitled to tell people what you think they should do?*

*People will never tell you what they actually think and how they actually feel. They’ll hate you for putting these ideas out there, and they’ll pretend to be your friend.* 

*White people will never agree to cede a fraction of their power in their personal lives. They’d never admit it, but they won’t. Everyone is conditioned to feel like a have-not, and thus will give themselves permission to hold onto what ‘little’ they have until they 'have more to give’.* 

*You’re not BIPOC. Why are you drawing attention to yourself? This moment is not about you.*

*Don’t engage with white people. They’re feeling emotionally straightjacketed and looking for a place to dump their toxicity without being held accountable. Don’t be the dumping ground.*

*Why can’t you just thrive like [insert name here]? They’re doing fine, why aren’t you?*

*Stop pretending like you’re publishing this blog to help other people, including BIPOC. You’re self-centered and petulant. Maybe no one in your life has actually ever accused you of being these things but you’re self-centered and you don’t think things through.* 

*Don’t expect anyone to read what you write. They don’t listen to you when you talk. Take a clue.* 

*You’re too old.*

*You’re too young.*

*Mothers should stay out of intellectual discourse. They’re too distracted and sleep-deprived to make a coherent point.* 

*You’re not well-read enough.*

*You haven’t run your ideas by other people to get their feedback and buy-in, therefore these ideas are not to see the light of day.*

*You’re foolish.*

*Why are you trying to ruin your relationships? Is this another episode of self-sabotage? Grow up.* 

*Now is not the time for a voice like yours. People don’t listen to people like you. They don’t have to, so they won’t.* 

*There’s just something wrong with you. Not sure what it is, but you’re surely the problem. Why else would you feel so terrible?* 

*None of your ideas will ever go anywhere until they’ve been expressed by a white man or a white woman.* 

*There are so many other things you should be doing, you know, to like make money. Where are your priorities? Stop frittering away your time and energy.* 

The patriarchy, white and otherwise, take up so much space in my head. It truly feels revolutionary to finally ignore this voice and write this blog anyway.

I’d rather find out that any one of the statements above is true than to be silenced through fear and conditioning.

Also, take the above into consideration before sending me a shitty email.
